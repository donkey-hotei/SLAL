    # algorithm will iterate through the column labels in order.
    # in each iteration the algorithm finds a list rows_with_nonzero from the
    # rows with nonzero entries
    # rows that have nonzero entries in the current column
    # The algorithm will then select one of these rows (the pivot row)
    # and adds it to the new_rowlist,
    # and removes it from rows_left
