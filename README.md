# Sparse Linear Algebra Library
A simple library written in pure-python for exploring problems in linear algebra. This library
is meant for educational purposes only (i.e: as a way for the lousy developer who created this
library to learn concepts in linear algebra in an applied manner, as being able to tell a machine
how-to-do is an excellent litmus test for one's own knowledge).

Library is only compatible with Python3 or greater & will likely never become backwards compatible.

## Installation
Installation is simple.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/donkey-hotei/SLAL.git
cd SLAL && python setup.py install
```
