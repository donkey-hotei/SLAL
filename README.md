The Sparse Linear Algebra library (SLAL) was developed not to be a full fledged 
module to be used in actual scientific work but as a tool for students to learn
linear algebra and programming side by side using Python. 
With this, there are some iPython notebooks which demonstrate the applications
of linear algebra in computer science.
